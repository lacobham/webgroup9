	  <p>	Turtles in Ontario face a constant threats during their active seasons, the biggest one being road mortality. As urbanization increases and roads continue to fragment turtle habitats, 
		the risk of turtle-vehicular collisions increases. Factors such as the slow mobility of turtles, their nesting behaviours, and a lack of driver awareness have all contributed to the high mortality rate of turtles. By raising awareness about this issue,  proactive protection measures can be implemented
		through communities working together to address this challenge. To learn more about Ontario turtles and the risks they face, check out our ArcGIS StoryMap.

	        Our team wanted to use our environmental backgrounds to come up with a real-life problem that we could contribute to and provide a web solution for. More on this problem can be found in the 'Problem' tab. Therefore, we explored different 
		web technologies to find the best options that allow for the collection of citizen science data and illustrate turtle sightings in Ontario. Our solutions to this project can be found in this website's 'Solutions' tab. For more on the team that created this site, check out the 'Team' tab!
