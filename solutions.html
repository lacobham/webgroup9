    <p>If we happened to have a form where we can report down information like how many turtles you see on a road and in what condition. Then, there's a big screen that shows this information in a cool way, like on a map or in a graph, with all the informative statistics. When we fill out the form, the screen updates automatically to show the new information right away. This can what happen when we link the form (Survey123) and the screen (dashboard) together. We learned, that way, we can make sure everyone sees the latest information as soon as it's reported down.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Here, we have an existing Survey123 form that is conveniently accessible through the link above. Clicking on the link will take us straight to the website where we can access the form using our organization's login credentials. This form is designed to gather specific information efficiently and securely, streamlining the data collection process for our project.</b></p>

    <br>
    <p><b>We are presented with this interface when our turtle survey form is clicked upon, and by clicking on the Collaborate tab on top, we can access and adjust various settings as needed. But most importantly, for our specified purpose, we select "PUBLIC" to who we choose to submit the form.</b></p>

    <br>
    <p><b>In AGOL (ArcGIS Online)Make the hosted feature layer of the form public by enabling public data collection in the Settings tab of the hosted feature layer item. Making the hosted feature layer of the form public and enabling public data collection in the settings tab allows anyone, including those without specific log-in credentials, to access and submit data to the form. This can be useful for gathering information from a wider audience or for making the form more accessible for general use.</b></p>

    <br>
    <p><b>Now, here's an example of how the dashboard content pane looks like with the existing form. It includes all the reported attributes from the form and has a Turtles Count as an overall count to all the reportings being made. But if we do not do the linking at all and let it be as an independent Dashboard, it'll only give us the saved data from our own shared dataset while building this Dashboard. Even if it is connected with the form's submitted data, it only exists with the latest data used to make the Dashboard from scratch. No way we can view any live update of the form here, unless .  .  . we follow what I'm implying here. </b></p>

    <p><b>Let's fill up the form as a random user (Daffy Duck a.k.a Celebrity Moment) who is reporting from San Francisco.

<p>Dashboard text & screenshots (*Include that heat map didn't work with slider)</p>
	<p>We learned how to utilize layer views in our Dashboard, by filtering fields we wanted to keep anonymous and creating a study area to limit the data shown on the web map.
	We hid fields like name and email, as well as the automatic fields added by Esri. As well, we drew a polygon around Ontario so any turtles sighted outside could be reported but would not be shown.</p>
	<img src="photos/Layerviewforsurvey.png" alt="Layer view study area/fields" class="responsiveImages, imageclass">
	<p>You can see that the layer view worked because when querying the layer in the REST Endpoint, it shows 10 results, or 10 turtle sightings.</p>  
	<img src="photos/query.PNG" alt="Query results" class="responsiveImages, imageclass">
	<p>When looking at the Dashboard itself, it only showing 9 turtle sightings, because one of them was in the U.S., so the layer view filters this from the map.</p>
	<img src="photos/view.PNG" alt="View results" class="responsiveImages, imageclass">
	<hr>
	<h4>The Final Dashboard</h4>
	<p>We created a dashboard using ArcGIS Dashboards to be able to show the data that was received from our survey in an interactive and fun, yet informative format. 
		Different elements were included in the dashboard including the overall map showing the collected points, in indicator stating more important and immediate 
		information, a list of all the points included in the layer being referenced, a gauge, a pie chart, and a bar graph. The final dashboard we completed can 
		be found *here* – if that doesn’t load it can be seen in the following screenshot</p>
	<img src="photos/dashboardrz.png" alt="Overall dashboard" class="responsiveImages, imageclass">
	<hr>
	<h4>Enhancements and Advanced Formatting</h4>
	<p>The main thing that was learned in depth and explored more when completing the dashboard was how to further enhance certain traits of specific elements, such 
		as the indicator and the list elements. Both of these have the options to add advanced formatting to them, as well as add in-line CSS to some of the text 
		and displays – such as adding padding around the titles of most of the elements to ensure equal spacing.</p>
	<p>An example of additional HTML/CSS formatting can be seen in the title of the list element on the dashboard, titled ‘Turtles in area’. A screenshot can be seen here:</p>
	<img src="photos/dashboardhtml.png" alt="HTML in dashboard" class="imageclass, smallimage">
	<hr>
	<p>The CSS added to the source option in the title formatting allows it to have a darker green background than the rest of the table, a larger font size than the normal 
		heading sizes, and added padding on the bottom to make the title centered vertically in the green border as well.</p>
	<p>As mentioned before, along with adding CSS to certain text, Dashboards also gives you the option to do advanced formatting to further enhance your elements and data. 
		A screenshot can be seen below of the advanced formatting window of the same list element:</p>
	<img src="photos/dashboardadvfor.png" alt="Advanced formatting using Arcade language" class="imageclass, smallimage">
	<hr>
	<p>When writing advanced formatting, the code is in the Arcade language. This script is creating a new variable to show in the list called ‘timeFormatted’. This script 
		is giving the list a way to show the amount of time between when the turtle was seen and the current time. This can be seen in the next screenshot, where the 
		variable is being called with ‘{expression/timeFormatted} in the template box, and having the output of the time at the end of the first lines (i.e. 6 days): </p>
	<img src="photos/dashboardformat.png" alt="Formatting the list" class="imageclass, smallimage">
	<hr>
	<h4>Limitations</h4>
	<p>Although these methods give a nice way to look at the data, there are some limitations of dashboards. These limitations are noted below:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>-	When filling out the source CSS/HTML and switching from the source screen (where the CSS is inputted) to the format screen, if anything is incorrectly 
			typed in, the format will change to include the entire code (which will then display on the format) and replace certain symbols with their UTF-8 entities 
			(‘<’ will become ‘&lt;’). If this occurs, there is no way to undo it to get the old working code back, meaning it will have to be retyped again.</li>
		<li>-	Without properly formatting the title of elements to be inside a ‘div’ or something similar, if the dashboard gets downsized enough, the titles inside 
			elements will be cut out or covered over by the rest of the information in the element, making them unreadable without expanding them, which covers the 
			rest of the information on the dashboard.</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
  	<h4>Custom Icons on Dashboards</h4>
	<p>A cool tool we learned was creating custom icons inside of Dashboard indicators using free SVG files. To create these icons all you have to do is go into the "Indicator" tab and click on the "Add icon", inside you will have the option to choose a custom icon.
	This is where you insert the SVG code that connects to your icon, to get this just download the SVG file and open its page source to get the code. Below is an example of what the workflow looks like in Dashboard.</p>
	<img src="photos/customIcon.png" alt="Custom Icon" class="imageclass, smallimage">
	<hr>
	<h4>Stacking Element on Dashboard </h4>
	<p> There is a visualization trick in Dashboard that allow you to stack elements together like graphs, indicators, and gauges into one element. Each element added gets its own tab that the user can rename. This allows the user to add more information onto the Dashboard since it reduces space.
	This can be done by adding new elements on top of each other and holding "Shift", this will stack them together within the same space. Below is an example of the workflow within Dashbaord. </p>

	<h4>Custom Theme</h4>
	<p>To make our ArcGIS StoryMap we first made a custom theme called 'Turtles', which used the same colour as the bottom of the header. 
	This allowed our StoryMap to flow smoothly rather than having a harsh divide between elements.</p>
	<img src="photos/theme.png" alt="StoryMaps custom theme" class="imageclass, smallimage">
	<p>We also used a custom separator to fit our overall message, making sure to have a transparent background so it blends in seamlessly.</p>

	<h4>Interactive Maps</h4>
	<p>Our StoryMap has a map tour and an embedded web map from the results of our Survey123 form, letting the user move around and interact with specific points to get more information.</p>

	<h4>Embedded Link Cards</h4>

	solutions could be combined.</p>
